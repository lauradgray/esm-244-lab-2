## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(MASS) #ordinal logistic regression
library(RColorBrewer)
library(factoextra) #view outcomes of ordination methods
library(shinythemes)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)

library(devtools)
install_github("vqv/ggbiplot", force = TRUE)
```


```{r}

library(readr)
pol_party <- read_csv("pol_party.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() # janitor function for snake case

```

   
```{r, message = FALSE}
select <- dplyr::select
```

###1. OLR with political party (Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/8n6s4/)

####a. Get data (pol_party.csv) and do some wrangling

```{r, message = FALSE}


pol_df <- pol_party %>% 
  select(birth_year, gender, ethnicity, political_party) %>% 
  filter(birth_year > 1900, political_party != "NA", political_party <= 7) %>% 
  mutate(age = 2016 - birth_year)

# For political party: 1 = very liberal, 4 = moderate, 7 = very conservative

# Coerce to factors (including ordered factor for the ranking of political party)

pol_df$political_party <- factor(pol_df$political_party, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7")) # Check class and levels to ensure

# Then update the gender and ethnicity variables to factors (unordered)

pol_df$ethnicity <- factor(pol_df$ethnicity)
pol_df$gender <- factor(pol_df$gender) 

# Then we can run ordinal logistic regression, but we should do some visualization first.

```

- Exploratory visualization


```{r, message = FALSE}

counts_eth <- pol_df %>% 
  group_by(ethnicity, political_party) %>% 
  tally()

counts_g <- pol_df %>% 
  group_by(gender, political_party) %>% 
  tally()

# Exploratory graphs

ggplot(pol_df, aes(x = age, y = political_party)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = ethnicity)) # no notable effect of age

ggplot(pol_df, aes(x = political_party)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = ethnicity), stat = "count") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlGnBu") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "NA") +
  facet_wrap(~ethnicity, scales = "free")

ggplot(pol_df, aes(x = political_party)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = gender), stat = "count") +
  facet_wrap(~gender)

```

# *Started Lab Here, aghhhh*

- Ordinal logistic regression using MASS::polr
- **Warning: these data are precarious and N is too small! For groups**
- 1 = liberal, 7 = conservative

```{r}

pol_model <- polr(political_party ~ age + gender + ethnicity, data = pol_df)
#polr = proportional odds logistic regression, in base R package

summary(pol_model)
# Conclusions: remember that these values are log-odds, where log-odds = 0 means no effect (odds = 1); interpret values as an increase in log-odds of that variable in relation to the reference variable (Female, Asian)

# understand in "odds" instead of log-odds:
exp(coef(pol_model))
# Conclusions: age doesn't seem to have an effect on political party; ...

############

# Once we've decided on a model, we can always make predictions using it:

predictions <- predict(pol_model, type = "probs")
df <- data.frame(pol_df, predictions)
```

###2. PCA

Using WorldBank environmental indicators

##**ggbiplot not working**
```{r}

#read in a cleaned version, see key for more info
wb_10 <- read_csv("wb_10.csv") %>% 
  select(-X1) %>%
  column_to_rownames('code')

#use PCA to start examining relationships between variables
#feed it the CONTINUOUS VARIABLES you want to see
wb_pca <- prcomp(wb_10[3:8], scale = TRUE) #columns 3 through 8
summary(wb_pca)
# Conclusions: six variables = 6 principle components! we've explained 74% of data with first two PCA

#we use ggbiplot for visualization because it has a similar syntax to ggplot
ggbiplot(wb_pca, groups = w_10$region) + #color things based on region!
  geom_text_repel(label = rownames(wb_10), size = 2, segment.size = 0.2) +
  theme_classic


# factoextra package

# screeplot

fviz_screeplot(wb_pca)

# see contributions of variables to different components:

fviz_contrib(wb_pca, choice = "var", axes = 2, top = 6) #top allows you to limit how many variables you want to view
# Conclusion: dominated by ghg, methane, co2 (axes = 1); agland, electricity, airpoll (axes = 2)

# Biplot showing points and vectors:

fviz_pca_biplot(wb_pca, col.var = "cos2", label = "var", repel = TRUE)
#cos2 colors show which variables are the most strongly represented (ghg is strongly represented) - just look at loading values, though

```

###3. Shiny App

File - New shiny app
Check the file (marvel-wikia-data.csv) -> "copy to" marvel_lab02 folder that was just created
